      "\u001b[0m\u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mAbstractLarge Language Models (LLMs) exhibit robust problem-solving capabilities for diverse tasks. However, most LLM-based agents are designed as specific task solvers with sophisticated prompt engineering, rather than agents capable of learning and evolving through interactions. These task solvers necessitate manually crafted prompts to inform task rules and regulate LLM behaviors, inherently incapacitating to address complex dynamic scenarios e.g., large interactive games. In light of this, we propose Agent-Pro: an LLM-based Agent with Policy-level Reflection and Optimization that can learn a wealth of expertise from interactive experiences and progressively elevate its behavioral policy. Specifically, it involves a dynamic belief generation and reflection process for policy evolution. Rather than action-level reflection, Agent-Pro iteratively reflects on past trajectories and beliefs, ”fine-tuning” its irrational beliefs for a better policy. Moreover, a depth-first search is employed for policy optimization, ensuring continual enhancement in policy payoffs. Agent-Pro is evaluated across two games: Blackjack and Texas Hold’em, outperforming vanilla LLM and specialized models. Our results show Agent-Pro can learn and evolve in complex and dynamic scenes, which also benefits numerous LLM-based applications 111Code is in https://github.com/zwq2018/Agent-Pro.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m**Abstract Summary:**\n",

      "To develop an LLM-based agent better suited for interactive environments, we draw inspiration from the Theory of Mind (ToM) (Premack and Woodruff, 1978; Li et al., 2023b; Guo et al., 2023a). In this framework, human condenses perceptions of themselves (self-belief) and the external environment (social-belief) and then ground their decisions on these beliefs, or adjust incorrect beliefs in response to external feedback. We also design a belief-aware decision-making process for Agent-Pro, simulating human cognitive processes in social contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we need to define the policy of an LLM-based agent, which refers to a specific behavioral strategy guiding the agent to interact and complete tasks. It often involves complex prompts designed by experts, covering task rules, strategies, and output formats. In a zero-sum game with K​+​1𝐾+1K\\text{+}1 players (assuming playing order is (op1,our,op2,..,opK)(op_{1},our,op_{2},..,op_{K})), we denote the policy of our agent as π𝜋\\pi with some observable information, containing agent’s private information stsubscript𝑠𝑡{\\color[rgb]{1,0,0}s_{t}}, public information otsubscript𝑜𝑡{\\color[rgb]{0,0,1}o_{t}}, our own action atsubscript𝑎𝑡{\\color[rgb]{0,1,1}a_{t}}, and the actions of all opponents ato​p1,ato​p2,..,ato​pKa^{op_{1}}_{t},a^{op_{2}}_{t},..,a^{op_{K}}_{t}, where t𝑡t means t𝑡t-th rounds of a game. Therefore a complete game trajectory spanning t𝑡t rounds:\n",

      "\n",
      "Specifically, many text-based tasks have employed reflection strategies and immediate environmental feedback to correct prior actions. However, in many typical interaction scenarios with longer decision-making processes, action-level reflections are not directly applicable due to delayed feedback. Therefore, for such a long-horizon interaction process, Agent-Pro is instructed to focus on the rationality of beliefs and underlying behavioral policies rather than individual actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Belief Calibration As depicted in Figure 2, under the guidance of the current behavior policy, Agent-Pro generates actions based on self-belief and world-belief. If these beliefs are inaccurate, they may lead to irrational actions and eventual failure. Therefore, Agent-Pro examines the rationality of these beliefs based on the final results and reflectss on the reasons for the final failure.\n",
