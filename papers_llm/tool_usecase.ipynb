      "Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens’ Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory.\n",
      "Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length.\n",
      "Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach — but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size.\n",
      "We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a “sink” even if they are not semantically important.\n",
      "Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence length without any fine-tuning.\n",
      "We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n",
      "In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2×\\times speedup.\n",
      "Code and datasets are provided in the link.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe abstract of the paper \"Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks\" highlights the following key points:\n",

      "While the window attention technique offers efficiency during inference, it results in an exceedingly high language modeling perplexity. Consequently, the model’s performance is unsuitable for deployment in streaming applications. In this section, we use the concept of attention sink to explain the failure of window attention, serving as the inspiration behind StreamingLLM.\n",

      "Figure 3 shows the perplexity of language modeling on a 20K token text. It is evident that perplexity spikes when the text length surpasses the cache size, led by the exclusion of initial tokens. This suggests that the initial tokens, regardless of their distance from the tokens being predicted, are crucial for maintaining the stability of LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why do LLMs break when removing initial tokens’ KV?\n",
      "\n",
      "We visualize attention maps from all layers and heads of the Llama-2-7B and models in Figure 2. We find that, beyond the bottom two layers, the model consistently focuses on the initial tokens across all layers and heads. The implication is clear: removing these initial tokens’ KV will remove a considerable portion of the denominator in the SoftMax function (Equation 1) in attention computation. This alteration leads to a significant shift in the distribution of attention scores away from what would be expected in normal inference settings.\n",

      "There are two possible explanations for the importance of the initial tokens in language modeling: (1) Either their semantics are crucial, or\n",
      "(2) the model learns a bias towards their absolute position. To distinguish between these possibilities, we conduct experiments (Table 1), wherein the first four tokens are substituted with the linebreak token “\\n\". The observations indicate that the model still significantly emphasizes these initial linebreak tokens. Furthermore, reintroducing them restores the language modeling perplexity to levels comparable to having the original initial tokens. This suggests that the absolute position of the starting tokens, rather than their semantic value, holds greater significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "LLMs attend to Initial Tokens as Attention Sinks.\n",
      "\n",
      "To explain why the model disproportionately focuses on initial tokens—regardless of their semantic relevance to language modeling, we introduce the concept of “attention sink\". The nature of the SoftMax function (Equation 1) prevents all attended tokens from having zero values. This requires aggregating some information from other tokens across all heads in all layers, even if the current embedding has sufficient self-contained information for its prediction. Consequently, the model tends to dump unnecessary attention values to specific tokens. A similar observation has been made in the realm of quantization outliers (Xiao et al., 2023; Bondarenko et al., 2023), leading to the proposal of SoftMax-Off-by-One (Miller, 2023) as a potential remedy.\n",

      "Why do various autoregressive LLMs, such as Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia, consistently focus on initial tokens as their attention sinks, rather than other tokens? Our explanation is straightforward: Due to the sequential nature of autoregressive language modeling, initial tokens are visible to all subsequent tokens, while later tokens are only visible to a limited set of subsequent tokens. As a result, initial tokens are more easily trained to serve as attention sinks, capturing unnecessary attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve noted that LLMs are typically trained to utilize multiple initial tokens as attention sinks rather than just one. As illustrated in Figure 2, the introduction of four initial tokens, as attention sinks, suffices to restore the LLM’s performance. In contrast, adding just one or two doesn’t achieve full recovery. We believe this pattern emerges because these models didn’t include a consistent starting token across all input samples during pre-training. Although Llama-2 does prefix each paragraph with a “<s>\" token, it’s applied before text chunking, resulting in a mostly random token occupying the zeroth position. This lack of a uniform starting token leads the model to use several initial tokens as attention sinks. We hypothesize that by incorporating a stable learnable token at the start of all training samples, it could singularly act as a committed attention sink, eliminating the need for multiple initial tokens to ensure consistent streaming. We will validate this hypothesis in Section 3.3.\n",

      "\n",
      "To enable LLM streaming in already trained LLMs, we propose a straightforward method that can recover window attention’s perplexity without any model finetuning. Alongside the current sliding window tokens, we reintroduce a few starting tokens’ KV in the attention computation. The KV cache in StreamingLLM can be conceptually divided into two parts, as illustrated in Figure 4: (1) Attention sinks (four initial tokens) stabilize the attention computation; 2) Rolling KV Cache retains the most recent tokens, crucial for language modeling. StreamingLLM’ design is versatile and can be seamlessly incorporated into any autoregressive language model that employs relative positional encoding, such as RoPE (Su et al., 2021) and ALiBi (Press et al., 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "When determining the relative distance and adding positional information to tokens, StreamingLLM focuses on positions within the cache rather than those in the original text. This distinction is crucial for StreamingLLM’s performance. For instance, if the current cache (Figure 4) has tokens [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8] and is in the process of decoding the 9th token, the positions assigned are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], rather than the positions in the original text, which would be [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9].\n",
      "\n",
      "For encoding like RoPE, we cache the Keys of tokens prior to introducing the rotary transformation. Then, we apply position transformation to the keys in the rolling cache at each decoding phase. On the other hand, integrating with ALiBi is more direct. Here, the contiguous linear bias is applied instead of a ’jumping’ bias to the attention scores. This method of assigning positional embedding within the cache is crucial to StreamingLLM’s functionality, ensuring that the model operates efficiently even beyond its pre-training attention window size.\n",

However, current LLMs are predominantly pretrained on short text snippets, which compromises their effectiveness in processing the long-context prompts that are frequently encountered in practical scenarios. This article offers a comprehensive survey of the recent advancement in Transformer-based LLM architectures aimed at enhancing the long-context capabilities of LLMs throughout the entire model lifecycle, from pre-training through to inference. We first delineate and analyze the problems of handling long-context input and output with the current Transformer-based models. We then provide a taxonomy and the landscape of upgrades on Transformer architecture to solve these problems. Afterwards, we provide an investigation on wildly used evaluation necessities tailored for long-context LLMs, including datasets, metrics, and baseline models, as well as optimization toolkits such as libraries, frameworks, and compilers to boost the efficacy of LLMs across different stages in runtime. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential avenues for future research.

Yet, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores attention keys and values to avoid re-computations, significantly increases memory demands and becomes the new bottleneck in speed and memory usage. This memory demand increases with larger batch sizes and longer context lengths. Additionally, the inference speed is limited by the size of KV cache, as the GPU's SRAM must load the entire KV cache from the main GPU memory for each token generated, causing the computational core to be idle during this process. A straightforward and effective solution to reduce KV cache size is quantization, which decreases the total bytes taken by KV cache. However, there is a lack of in-depth studies that explore the element distribution of KV cache to understand the hardness and limitation of KV cache quantization. To fill the gap, we conducted a comprehensive study on the element distribution in KV cache of popular LLMs. Our findings indicate that the key cache should be quantized per-channel, i.e., group elements along the channel dimension and quantize them together. In contrast, the value cache should be quantized per-token. From this analysis, we developed a tuning-free 2bit KV cache quantization algorithm, named KIVI. With the hardware-friendly implementation, KIVI can enable Llama (Llama-2), Falcon, and Mistral models to maintain almost the same quality while using $\\\\mathbf{2.6\\\\times}$ less peak memory usage (including the model weight). This reduction in memory usage enables up to $\\\\mathbf{4\\\\times}$ larger batch size, bringing $\\\\mathbf{2.35\\\\times \\\\sim 3.47\\\\times}$ throughput on real LLM inference workload.

We hypothesize that long context modeling, in particular \\\\textit{the ability to utilize information at arbitrary input locations}, is a capability that is mostly already acquired through large-scale pretraining, and that this capability can be readily extended to contexts substantially longer than seen during training~(e.g., 4K to 128K) through lightweight continual pretraining on appropriate data mixture. We investigate the \\\\textit{quantity} and \\\\textit{quality} of the data for continual pretraining: (1) for quantity, we show that 500 million to 5 billion tokens are enough to enable the model to retrieve information anywhere within the 128K context; (2) for quality, our results equally emphasize \\\\textit{domain balance} and \\\\textit{length upsampling}. Concretely, we find that naively upsampling longer data on certain domains like books, a common practice of existing work, gives suboptimal performance, and that a balanced domain mixture is important. We demonstrate that continual pretraining of the full model on 1B-5B tokens of such data is an effective and affordable strategy for scaling the context length of language models to 128K.

The attention module in these architectures, however, exhibits quadratic time and space in input size, limiting their scalability for long-sequence modeling. State Space Models (SSMs), and more specifically Selective SSMs (S6), with efficient hardware-aware implementation, have shown promising potential for long causal sequence modeling. They, however, use separate blocks for each channel and fail to filter irrelevant channels and capture inter-channel dependencies. Natural attempt to mix information across channels using MLP, attention, or SSMs results in further instability in the training of SSMs for large networks and/or nearly double the number of parameters. We present the MambaMixer block, a new SSM-based architecture with data-dependent weights that uses a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels-called Selective Token and Channel Mixer. To mitigate doubling the number of parameters, we present a new non-causal heuristic of the S6 block with a hardware-friendly implementation. We further present an efficient variant of MambaMixer, called QSMixer, that mixes information along both sequence and embedding dimensions. As a proof of concept, we design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Vision QSMixer (ViQS) architectures. To enhance their ability to capture spatial information in images, we present Switch of Scans (SoS) that dynamically uses a set of useful image scans to traverse image patches.

However, this simple retrieval-based test is indicative of only a superficial form of long-context understanding. To provide a more comprehensive evaluation of long-context LMs, we create a new synthetic benchmark RULER with flexible configurations for customized sequence length and task complexity. RULER expands upon the vanilla NIAH test to encompass variations with diverse types and quantities of needles. Moreover, RULER introduces new task categories multi-hop tracing and aggregation to test behaviors beyond searching from context. We evaluate ten long-context LMs with 13 representative tasks in RULER. Despite achieving nearly perfect accuracy in the vanilla NIAH test, all models exhibit large performance drops as the context length increases. While these models all claim context sizes of 32K tokens or greater, only four models (GPT-4, Command-R, Yi-34B, and Mixtral) can maintain satisfactory performance at the length of 32K.
