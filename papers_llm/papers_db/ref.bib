  title         = "{GPT-4} Technical Report",
  author        = "{OpenAI}",
  abstract      = "We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale,
                   multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and
                   produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many
                   real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance
                   on various professional and academic benchmarks, including
                   passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top
                   10\% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model
                   pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The
                   post-training alignment process results in improved
                   performance on measures of factuality and adherence to
                   desired behavior. A core component of this project was
                   developing infrastructure and optimization methods that
                   behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This
                   allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4's
                   performance based on models trained with no more than
                   1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4.",
