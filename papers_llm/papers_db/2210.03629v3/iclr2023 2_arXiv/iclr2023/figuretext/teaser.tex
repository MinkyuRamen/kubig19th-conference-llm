    \caption{(1) Comparison of 4 prompting methods, (a) \palm{}, (b) Chain-of-thought (\reason{}, Reason Only), (c) \act{}-only, and (d) \model{} (Reason+Act), solving a HotpotQA~\citep{yang2018hotpotqa} question. 
    (2) Comparison of (a) \act{}-only and (b) \model{} prompting to solve an AlfWorld~\citep{shridhar2020alfworld} game. 
    In both domains, we omit in-context examples in the prompt, and only show task solving trajectories generated by the model (Act, Thought) and the environment (Obs).
