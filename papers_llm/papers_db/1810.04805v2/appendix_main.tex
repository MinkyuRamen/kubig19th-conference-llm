{\bf \large{
    Appendix for ``BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding''}}
\end{center}


We organize the appendix into three sections:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Additional implementation details for BERT are presented in Appendix~\ref{appendix:sec:bert_description};
   
   \item Additional details for our experiments are presented in Appendix~\ref{appendix:sec:exp_details}; and
   
   
   \item Additional ablation studies are presented in Appendix~\ref{appendix:sec:more_ablation_studies}.
   
   We present additional ablation studies for BERT including:
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Effect of Number of Training Steps; and
      \item Ablation for Different Masking Procedures.
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
