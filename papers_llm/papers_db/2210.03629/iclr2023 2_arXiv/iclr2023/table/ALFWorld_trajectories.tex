We provide an example trajectory of \model{}, \act{}, and \modelim{} on the same ALFWorld game, \texttt{pick\_clean\_then\_place\_in\_recep-Knife-None-CounterTop-10/\\trial\_T20190909\_110445\_675754}.

\subsubsection{\act{} trajectory}
\label{appendix:act_ALFWorld_trajectory}

\act{} is able to correctly find the knife, but tries to clean it using a sinkbasin before actually going to the sinkbasin. From there on, the model is unable to recover, and is stuck repeating the same sequence of commands. With \model{}, an existing thought would have concretely identified that the knife had been taken, and that the next subgoal was to go to a sinkbasin to clean it.

\subsubsection{\modelim{} trajectory}
\label{appendix:reactim_ALFWorld_trajectory}

\modelim{} is able to correctly find the knife, but is unable to clean it as well. The LLM then gets stuck trying to place this knife on a countertop. One possible issue is the incorrect thought \texttt{think: I need to find a clean knife.}, which seems to trick the LLM in believing that the knife is already cleaned. In \model{}, this sequence of subgoals would be concretely captured by each thought.
