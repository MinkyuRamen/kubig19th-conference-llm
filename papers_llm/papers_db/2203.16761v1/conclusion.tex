We proposed MeMOT for online MOT by jointly performing the object detection and data association.
MeMOT preserves a large spatio-temporal memory and actively encodes the past observations via an attention-based aggregator. 
By representing objects as dynamically updated query embeddings, MeMOT predicts object states with an attention mechanism without any post-processing. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MeMOT on object localization and association in crowded scenes.

There are many real-world applications of MOT technology, such as patient or elderly health monitoring, autonomous driving, and collaborative robots. However, there could be unintended usages and we advocate responsible usage complying with applicable laws and regulations.
