In this paper, we answer the question \emph{can we enhance open-source LLMs to compete with leading closed LLM APIs in tool manipulation, with practical amount of human supervision}. 
Drawing from our observations of the common tool manipulation failures and insights from the literature on conventional NLP tasks with LLM, we propose to instantiate model alignment with programmatical data generation, system prompts, and in-context demonstration retrievers to improve the tool manipulation capability of open-source models.
To comprehensively evaluate the impact of these techniques, we create the \textit{\snact}, a benchmark consisting of diverse software tools for real-world tasks. 
Our results demonstrate that these techniques can make the leading open-source LLMs competitive with the OpenAI GPT-4 in $4$ out of $8$ \snact\  tasks, all achieved with a practical amount of human labeling effort.
