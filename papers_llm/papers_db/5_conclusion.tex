\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

We presented an inversion method for DDPM. Our noise maps encode the image structure more strongly than the noise maps in regular sampling, and are therefore better suited for image editing. We illustrated their advantages in text-based editing, both when used by themselves and in combination with other editing methods.

%In contrast to DDIM inversion, using our approach allows generating diverse results for any given image and text.

%this inversion produces edit firendly noise maps that simple manipulation over them translates to meaningful manipulations of the generated image.

%When fixing the noise maps while changing the condition of the model, i.e., text, the generated image is modified semantically but retains the structure. This property enables simple and fast text-guided editing. We also show that existing editing methods can change their DDIM inversion with ours and benefit from a quality improvement.

%Our inversion enable editing real images, without any optimization or model fine-tuning.
