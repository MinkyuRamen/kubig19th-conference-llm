However, their potential to effectively use tools via API calls remains unfulfilled. This is a challenging task even for today's state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, largely due to their inability to generate accurate input arguments and their tendency to hallucinate the wrong usage of an API call. We release Gorilla, a finetuned LLaMA-based model that surpasses the performance of GPT-4 on writing API calls. When combined with a document retriever, Gorilla demonstrates a strong capability to adapt to test-time document changes, enabling flexible user updates or version changes. It also substantially mitigates the issue of hallucination, commonly encountered when prompting LLMs directly. To evaluate the model's ability, we introduce APIBench, a comprehensive dataset consisting of HuggingFace, TorchHub, and TensorHub APIs. The successful integration of the retrieval system with Gorilla demonstrates the potential for LLMs to use tools more accurately, keep up with frequently updated documentation, and consequently increase the reliability and applicability of their outputs. Gorilla's code, model, data, and demo are available at https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu\", 'influentialCitationCount': 29, 'publicationDate': '2023-05-24'}, {'paperId': '58f8925a8b87054ad0635a6398a7fe24935b1604', 'title': 'Mind2Web: Towards a Generalist Agent for the Web', 'abstract': 'We introduce Mind2Web, the first dataset for developing and evaluating generalist agents for the web that can follow language instructions to complete complex tasks on any website. Existing datasets for web agents either use simulated websites or only cover a limited set of websites and tasks, thus not suitable for generalist web agents. With over 2,000 open-ended tasks collected from 137 websites spanning 31 domains and crowdsourced action sequences for the tasks, Mind2Web provides three necessary ingredients for building generalist web agents: 1) diverse domains, websites, and tasks, 2) use of real-world websites instead of simulated and simplified ones, and 3) a broad spectrum of user interaction patterns. Based on Mind2Web, we conduct an initial exploration of using large language models (LLMs) for building generalist web agents. While the raw HTML of real-world websites are often too large to be fed to LLMs, we show that first filtering it with a small LM significantly improves the effectiveness and efficiency of LLMs. Our solution demonstrates a decent level of performance, even on websites or entire domains the model has never seen before, but there is still a substantial room to improve towards truly generalizable agents. We open-source our dataset, model implementation, and trained models (https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/Mind2Web) to facilitate further research on building a generalist agent for the web.', 'influentialCitationCount': 26, 'publicationDate': '2023-06-09'}, {'paperId': '0bfc804e31eecfd77f45e4ee7f4d629fffdcd628', 'title': 'ToolLLM: Facilitating Large Language Models to Master 16000+ Real-world APIs', 'abstract': 'Despite the advancements of open-source large language models (LLMs), e.g., LLaMA, they remain significantly limited in tool-use capabilities, i.e., using external tools (APIs) to fulfill human instructions. The reason is that current instruction tuning largely focuses on basic language tasks but ignores the tool-use domain. This is in contrast to the excellent tool-use capabilities of state-of-the-art (SOTA) closed-source LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolLLM, a general tool-use framework encompassing data construction, model training, and evaluation. We first present ToolBench, an instruction-tuning dataset for tool use, which is constructed automatically using ChatGPT. Specifically, the construction can be divided into three stages: (i) API collection: we collect 16,464 real-world RESTful APIs spanning 49 categories from RapidAPI Hub; (ii) instruction generation: we prompt ChatGPT to generate diverse instructions involving these APIs, covering both single-tool and multi-tool scenarios; (iii) solution path annotation: we use ChatGPT to search for a valid solution path (chain of API calls) for each instruction. To enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we develop a novel depth-first search-based decision tree algorithm. It enables LLMs to evaluate multiple reasoning traces and expand the search space. Moreover, to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of LLMs, we develop an automatic evaluator: ToolEval. Based on ToolBench, we fine-tune LLaMA to obtain an LLM ToolLLaMA, and equip it with a neural API retriever to recommend appropriate APIs for each instruction. Experiments show that ToolLLaMA demonstrates a remarkable ability to execute complex instructions and generalize to unseen APIs, and exhibits comparable performance to ChatGPT.

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans.

Here is an explanation of the math expression related to filtering API calls as presented in the paper:\\n\\nThe paper introduces a weighted cross-entropy loss function for a model M over a sequence of tokens xi,...,xn, where i represents the position of the API call ci in the sequence and ri represents the response from the API. The loss function is defined as:\\n\\nLi(z) = -∑j=i^n wj-i * log pM(xj | z, x1:j-1)\\n\\nIn this expression:\\n- z represents the prefix for the model M.\\n- wj-i is a sequence of weights.\\n- pM(xj | z, x1:j-1) is the conditional probability of token xj given the prefix z and the tokens x1 to xj-1.\\n\\nThe paper compares two variations of this loss function:\\n1. Li+ = Li(e(ci, ri)): This represents the weighted loss over all tokens if the model is given the API call and its result as a prefix.\\n2. Li- = min(Li(ε), Li(e(ci, ε)): This represents the minimum loss obtained when either no API call is made or when an API call is made without providing the response.\\n\\nThe paper introduces a filtering threshold τf, where API calls are kept only if the difference between Li- and Li+ is greater than or equal to τf. In other words, an API call is considered helpful if providing both the input and output of the call reduces the loss by at least τf compared to not making the call or not receiving the response.\\n\\nThis approach aims to determine the relevance and impact of API calls on the model\\'s prediction accuracy, ensuring that only beneficial API calls are incorporated into the model\\'s learning process.'),\n","  HumanMessage(content='explain about the Dataset Generation Part'),\n","  AIMessage(content='The dataset generation process in the paper \"ToolFormer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools\" involves the following key steps and considerations:\\n\\n1. **Dataset Selection**: The paper uses a subset of CCNet as the language modeling dataset 𝒞 and GPT-J as the language model M. This choice of datasets provides the foundation for training and evaluating the language model\\'s performance.\\n\\n2. **Heuristics for API Calls**: To reduce the computational cost of annotating the dataset with API calls, the paper defines heuristics for certain APIs. These heuristics help identify a subset of the dataset where API calls are more likely to be beneficial. For example, texts related to the calculator tool are considered only if they contain at least three numbers.\\n\\n3. **Dataset Filtering**: After defining the heuristics and selecting the subset of the dataset, the paper performs filtering steps to eliminate examples where all API calls are deemed unnecessary. This filtering process ensures that only relevant examples with potentially helpful API calls are retained for further analysis.\\n\\n4. **Weighting Function**: The paper introduces a weighting function to determine the importance of API calls in the dataset. The weighting function ensures that API calls occur close to where the information provided by the API is most beneficial for the model\\'s learning process.\\n\\n5. **Threshold Selection**: Individual thresholds τs and τf are chosen for each tool to ensure a sufficient number of examples for training. These thresholds are crucial in determining the relevance and impact of API calls on the dataset.\\n\\n6. **Dataset Statistics**: The paper provides relevant statistics of the final dataset augmented with API calls, showcasing the number of examples for different tools and filtering thresholds. The table presented in the paper displays the number of examples with API calls for various filtering threshold values.\\n\\nOverall, the dataset generation process in the paper involves careful selection, heuristic definition, filtering, weighting, and threshold setting to create a dataset that facilitates the training and evaluation of language models with integrated API calls.')],\n"," 'output': 'The method described in the paper \"ToolFormer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools\" focuses on equipping a language model (M) with the ability to utilize different tools through API calls. Here is a summary of the approach outlined in the paper:\\n\\n1. **Representation of API Calls**: Each API call is represented as a tuple (ac, ic), where ac is the API name and ic is the corresponding input. The API call without the result is denoted as e(c) and with the result as e(c, r), using special tokens to mark the start and end of each call.\\n\\n2. **Dataset Augmentation**: The dataset of plain texts is converted into an augmented dataset with API calls in three steps: sampling potential API calls using prompts, executing the API calls to obtain results, and filtering the API calls based on their impact on predicting future tokens.\\n\\n3. **Sampling API Calls**: The language model is prompted to annotate examples with API calls by sampling candidate positions for API calls based on the model\\'s probabilities. API calls are generated by sampling from the model given specific prefixes and end-of-sequence tokens.\\n\\n4. **Executing API Calls**: The generated API calls are executed to obtain the corresponding results. The method of execution depends on the specific API, such as calling another neural network or using a retrieval system.\\n\\n5. **Filtering API Calls**: The paper introduces a weighted cross-entropy loss function to compare the impact of API calls on the model\\'s prediction accuracy. API calls are filtered based on whether providing the input and output of the call reduces the loss by a certain threshold compared to not making the call or not receiving the response.\\n\\n6. **Model Finetuning**: After sampling, executing, and filtering API calls, the remaining calls are merged with the original inputs to create an augmented dataset. The model is finetuned on this dataset using a standard language modeling objective, enabling it to learn how and when to use different tools based on its own feedback.\\n\\n7. **Inference**: During text generation after finetuning, the model is interrupted when it expects an API call response, the appropriate API is called to get the response, and decoding continues after inserting the response and end-of-sequence token.\\n\\nThis method allows the language model to learn to use tools through API calls and improve its performance in various tasks by leveraging external resources and information.'}"]},"execution_count":19,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["agent_with_chat_history.invoke(\n","    {\"input\": \"explain about the Method\"},\n","    config={\"configurable\": {\"session_id\": \"<test_session_id>\"}},\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bbxP_Psuwg-E"},"source":["### Todo : Make Agent with Llama"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"wULDS5ozwg-F"},"outputs":[],"source":["os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = \"0\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"4AvoAOTmwg-F","outputId":"fc02781b-fbe0-47da-c521-c555fcc589bf"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Downloading shards:  25%|██▌       | 1/4 [00:00<00:02,  1.20it/s]"]}],"source":["# we can use 262k version of Llama!\n","model_name = 'gradientai/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-262k'\n","\n","dtype = \"float16\"\n","if torch.cuda.is_bf16_supported():\n","    dtype = \"bfloat16\"\n","\n","quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_4bit=True)\n","model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=getattr(torch, dtype), quantization_config=quantization_config,\n","                                             device_map=\"auto\",  cache_dir=os.getenv(\"HF_HOME\", \"~/.cache/huggingface\"))\n","model.eval()\n","\n","tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"nmpO15ehwg-G"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zrfI9u3YHYxw"},"source":["### (deprecated) HTML "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["is moved to getpaper.py\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":365,"status":"ok","timestamp":1719243752174,"user":{"displayName":"최유민","userId":"14691279395225646105"},"user_tz":-540},"id":"wj5T-OOHHu32"},"outputs":[],"source":["import requests\n","from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n","from requests.exceptions import RequestException\n","import PyPDF2\n","import re\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":20,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3,"status":"ok","timestamp":1719243801997,"user":{"displayName":"최유민","userId":"14691279395225646105"},"user_tz":-540},"id":"DjVjHTaxSIL4"},"outputs":[],"source":["import requests\n","from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n","from requests.exceptions import RequestException\n","import PyPDF2\n","import re\n","import os\n","\n","class GetPaper:\n","    def __init__(self, ss_api_key, ar5iv_mode = True, path_db='./papers_db', page_limit = 5):\n","        self.ss_api_key = ss_api_key\n","        self.ar5iv_mode = ar5iv_mode\n","        self.path_db= path_db\n","        self.page_limit = page_limit\n","\n","    def get_paper_info_by_title(self, title):\n","        \"\"\"논문의 제목으로 정보를 가져오는 함수\"\"\"\n","        #
