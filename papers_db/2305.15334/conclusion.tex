LLMs are swiftly gaining popularity across diverse domains. In our study, we spotlight techniques designed to enhance the LLM's ability to accurately identify the appropriate API for a specific taskâ€”a significant but often overlooked aspect in the advancement of this technology. Since APIs function as a universal language enabling diverse systems to communicate effectively, their correct usage can boost the ability of LLMs to interact with tools in the wider world.
In this paper, we propose \oursmethod{}, a new novel pipeline for finetuning LLMs to call APIs. The finetuned model's performance surpasses prompting the state-of-the-art LLM (GPT-4) in three massive datasets we collected. \gorilla{} generates reliable API calls to ML models without hallucination, demonstrates an impressive capability to adapt to test-time API usage changes, and can satisfy constraints while picking APIs.
