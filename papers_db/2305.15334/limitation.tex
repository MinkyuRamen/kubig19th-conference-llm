\label{sec:limitation}

With the goal of wanting to have a challenging dataset, we chose ML APIs, given their functional similarity. The potential downside to APIs that focus on the ML domain, is their propensity to produce biased predictions if trained on skewed data, potentially disadvantaging certain sub-groups. To counter this concern and foster a deeper understanding of these APIs, we are releasing our extensive dataset, consisting of over 11,000 instruction-API pairs. This resource will serve the wider community as a valuable tool for studying and benchmarking existing APIs, contributing to a more fair and optimized usage of machine learning.
